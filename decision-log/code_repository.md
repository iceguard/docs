# Code repository

## Status

accepted

## Context

The team had to evaluate if the code should be stored in a private Azure repository or public accessible on Github.

## Decision

We decided for Github as we want to make the code accessible even after the project.

## Consequences

Code is splitted from the pipeline and user stories.
