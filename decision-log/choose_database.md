# Database

## Status

accepted

## Context

The team had to decide on a appropriate database for the data.

## Decision

Cosmos DB (Microsoft's variant for MongoDB) will do the job for us. 
As Cosmos is natively integrated in Azure, we are going further with MongoDB to store the JSON inputs easily.

## Consequences

No negative consequences known.
