# Frontend Framework

## Status

accepted

## Context

The framework choice is crucial as the IGSS dashboard will be built with that technology.

## Decision

React was chosen as the framework to go, as we have the most knowledge with it and we do not want to take additional risks with a new framework.

## Consequences

We accept the fact that complexity might increase because of the weight of the framework.
